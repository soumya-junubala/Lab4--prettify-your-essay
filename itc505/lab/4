    <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
    <p><strong>Everyone has a role to play in cybersecurity and cyber risk management, but people without security backgrounds seldom understand—let alone accept or endorse—such roles. Public and private organizations face common challenges in facilitating more secure behaviors among employees. As part of their missions, most colleges and universities in the United States have general education programs that aim to instill certain competencies and characteristics in all graduates (for individual and greater good). This paper proposes that a cybersecurity general education course could help improve common workplace challenges in cybersecurity training and awareness, and that such a course could align with each institution’s general education goals to benefit not only graduates but also communities and society writ large.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Keywords—</strong>cybersecurity education, risk management, general education, information security, computer security</p>

    <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>A successful cybersecurity posture means that an organization (a) is confident in its understanding of its cyber risks and (b) is comfortable with its current allocation of risk decisions related to protection/mitigation and incident response activities throughout the enterprise. Maintaining that successful posture requires regular re-evaluation of both (a) and (b) conditions, especially as internal and external changes occur.</p>
    <p>Cybersecurity  was  often  allocated  to  the  information  technology  (IT)  team  in  the  past,  but  the  pervasiveness  of  technology and interconnectedness of systems means that all end users should have a fundamental understanding of cyber risks and basic skills to fulfill their roles in relation to those risks.  Inherent  to  a  successful  cybersecurity  posture  is  an  organizational  culture  in  which  all  participants  not  only  understand their cybersecurity roles but also accept and even advocate  for  these  responsibilities.  Thus,  as  our  everyday  societal,  civic,  and  business  operations  have  increasingly  become    reliant    on    information    and    communication    technologies,  both  public  and  private  organizations  have  introduced cybersecurity training and awareness activities for their employees</p>
    <p>The  crux  of  these  activities  must  be  behavior  change: fostering   the   skills   and   attitude   shifts   needed   for   the   organization  to  achieve  its  desired  cybersecurity  posture.  This behavior change can provide benefits beyond a specific organization — i.e., the awareness and skills that end users learn  in  one  organization  can  carry  over  into  other  realms  such  as  their  families,  social/civic  communities,  and  future  employment@@@                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1,1           Top
    <p>As discussed in this paper, the commonalities within end-user  cybersecurity  training  and  awareness  needs,  and  the  benefits sympathetic to general education goals (individual, societal,  and  market  based),  combine  to  present  a  solid  argument  in  favor  of  including  cybersecurity  in  general  education.     SectionII     discusses     fundamentals     of     cybersecurity  knowledge  and  behaviors  needed  in  all  kindsof organizations. Section III presents a brief review of post-secondary  general  education  concepts  in  the  United  States  and a summary of prior literature on cybersecurity for general education.  Section  IV  analyzes  how  a  general  education  course for cybersecurity could help meet organizational and societal  needs  while  also  fulfilling  some  of  the  common  expectations and purposes for general education. Section V is a brief conclusion</p>
    <h2>II.CYBERSECURITY EXPECTATIONS</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity  standards  typically  require  not  only  role-based  training  (targeted  to  employees  with  specific  duties),  but also general training and awareness raising activities for all users authorized to access the organization’s systems [1], [2].   In   some   countries,   these   requirements   have   been   incorporated into regulations or other legal mechanisms [3], [4].   Similar   requirements   are   found   in   college-level cybersecurity curriculum guidelines such as [5], which, while targeted toward the education of cybersecurity professionals, also emphasizes that security professionals must be prepared to address cybersecurity training and awareness needs of all end users within their organizations.</p>
    <p>For  years,  organizations  in  both  the  private  and  public  sectors  have  endeavored  to  establish  and  maintain  general  cybersecurity     training/awareness     programs     for     their     employees. As noted by [6], many programs are focused on policy  compliance  and  are  based  on  rewards/sanctions  and  deterrence  theory,  but  these  may  not  be  the  most  effective  bases for encouraging secure behaviors.</p>
    <p>The importance of employees’ cybersecurity capabilities and behavior has been amplified by the growing integration of remote work structures and the increased use of personal devices and smart devices throughout organizations. In two large surveys [7], [8], 52% to 56% of respondents identified human error by their employees as the largest cybersecurity vulnerability for their organizations. Lessening the likelihood of errors, and mitigating the impacts when problems occur, are two of the goals of cybersecurity training and awareness programs.</p>
    <p>Other  studies  [6],  [10]  have  indicated  that  employees  engage   in   insecure   and   noncompliant   behavior   due   to   stressors  such  as  high  workloads,  perceived  barriers  to  efficient  task  completion,  and  a  mismatch  of  benefit/risk  calculation. So, even employees who are trained in and aware of  the  organization’s  cybersecurity  expectations  may  thus  justify      their      noncompliance      with      organizational      policies/rules;  these  attitudes  and  actions  can  negatively  impact an organization’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
    <p>Echoing these problems, Gartner [11] identified the goals of  “fostering  new  ways  of  thinking  and  embedding  new  behavior” as a key trend to help organizations move “beyond awareness”    in    their    general    employee    training    on    cybersecurity. Various scholars, such as [12] and [13], have emphasized  the  importance  of  involving  the  breadth  of  human  motivations  in  order  to  encourage  the  behavior  change  desired  by  cybersecurity  training  and  awareness  programs</p>
    <p>In the sections below, this paper proposes that a college-level general education course in cybersecurity could lay the foundations  for  more  positive  cybersecurity  attitudes  and  behavior,  so  that  more  employees  go  into  an  organization  with  clearer  expectations  and  firmer  acceptance  of  their  cybersecurity  roles  and  responsibilities,  and  with  enhanced  abilities  to  address  the  everyday  risk  decisions  related  to  cybersecurity.</p>
    <h2>III. BACKGROUND / LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>

    <b> A: General Education at U.S. Colleges and Universities </b>
    <p>In the United States, many higher education institutions use general education to try to inculcate certain kinds of behavior, ways of thinking, and common capabilities in all its graduates. The history of post-secondary general education shows a varied and contentious approach, with institutions typically choosing for themselves how and what to offer as general education [14]. Depending on an institution’s choices, general education can emphasize traditional liberal education or professionally targeted preparations for entering the workforce or a blend of both; and, as detailed more fully in [14], institutions may reconsider and reformulate their general education approaches as societies evolve and internal and external pressures come into play.</p>

    <p>A  full  discussion  of  the  social,  political,  and  economic  pressures  in  the  history  and  current  context  of  U.S.  general  education is beyond this paper, but [14] – [18] provide a solid overview.  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  summarize  the  goals and nature of post-secondary general education, laying a foundation for considering the inclusion of cybersecurity in such programs.</p>
    <p>General  education  often  encourages  exploration  into  broader  contexts  of  a  situation  or  discipline.  It  helps  to  develop    skills    for    extrapolating    beyond    one’s    own    experience/understanding   and   for   spotting   and   raising   questions that can facilitate new or better knowledge. And it exposes students to the processes required to participate and collaborate in solving complex problems. General education also   typically   cultivates   the   common   knowledge   and   capabilities necessary to communicate and engage as citizens and members of a community</p>
    <p>Depending   on   the   institution,   a   general   education   program  may  emphasize  select  moral  considerations  and  social  impacts  of  decision  making  (e.g.,  environmentalism,  inclusion/diversity,  tenets  of  a  certain  religion,  etc.).  Some  institutions may focus more on professional education goals in  their  general  education  efforts;  and  other  institutions’  general   education   may   embrace a   more   liberal   arts   experience.  Most  regional  accrediting  agencies  require  that  institutions   incorporate   both   career/life   preparation   and   citizen engagement into their curricula [19].</p>
    <p>Research on student perceptions about general education show   that   students   have   a   basic   understanding   and   appreciation  of  its  goals,  but  they  place  greater  value  on  discipline-specific courses which they presume have a more direct correlation to career success [18], [20]</p>
    <p>Although  each  institution  may  differ  in  approach,  the  common presumption of general education programs is that the  institution  wants  to  achieve  some  sort  of  minimal  commonality    in    its    graduates—e.g.,    basic    skills    for    functioning as individuals and as members of a community, fundamental  capabilities  of  certain  ways  of  thinking,  an  appreciation  of  and  advocacy  for  particular  characteristics,  etc. There is often a blend of goals and outcomes, with some focused  on  benefitting  the  individual  graduate  and  others  looking  to  benefit  communities  and  the  broader  society within which that graduate will live and work [14]</p>
    <p>As [14] – [19] show, establishing and revising a general education program are complicated endeavors that typically involve  intense  debates  about  priorities  and  resources.  For  those  lobbying  to  include  cybersecurity  within  a  general  education curriculum, it is vital to position the course within the    undergraduate    general    education    goals    and    the    institution’s overall culture.</p>


    <b> B: Cybersecurity within General Education </b>
    <p>While a good deal of literature has addressed improvements in education for cybersecurity-related disciplines and majors, e.g., [21] – [26], several scholars have provided argumentation and case studies supporting the addition of cybersecurity to post-secondary general education. Incorporating modern technology-related content into general education is not a new concept; the author previously worked for a Swedish university that was one of the first to mandate an information technology law course for all law students, and Caspersen [27] discussed the Danish and broader European movements to include informatics in general education for all education levels.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the military service academies were early  adopters  of  adding  cybersecurity  to  their  general  education curricula. As detailed in [28] and [29], their course content  is  generally  more  technically  oriented,  but  non-technical   courses   in   various   disciplines   also   address   cybersecurity concerns relevant to the professional missions and educational goals of those academies.</p>
    <p>The literature also has examples of cybersecurity courses incorporated   into   general   education   at   several   civilian   institutions  of  higher  education,  such  as  Slippery  Rock  University  [30],  Towson  University  [31],  the  College  of  Charleston [32], and Old Dominion University [33].</p>
    <p>Three of these courses are more technically oriented and include  assignments  that  develop  basic  skills  in  securing  devices,  analyzing  risks,  and  conducting  forensics  [31];  installing  and  securely  configuring  security  hardware  and  software  for  personal  and  home  use  [30];  and  conducting  traffic   analysis   related   to   denial-of-service   attacks   and   ransomware,   and   exploring   the   techniques   involved   in   password   cracking   and   device   hacking   [32].   Faculty   developing  these  courses  noted  that  one  of  the  biggest challenges  to  creating  a  general  education  cybersecurity  course  was  finding  suitable  course  materials,  since  most  cybersecurity textbooks and hands-on cybersecurity tools are targeted toward computing/IT majors [30] –   [32]</p>
    <p>While these three courses also touched on non-technical matters  related  to  cybersecurity,  the  fourth  case  study  from  Old  Dominion  University  showed  how  an  interdisciplinary  group  of  faculty  developed  a  less-technical  cybersecurity  course that adds more content related to the societal, cultural, economic, philosophical, and international considerations of cybersecurity [33]. The faculty for this course committed to using  only  open  educational  resources  (OER)  for  course  materials (in part due to the lack of an appropriate textbook, and in part due to the benefits of OER such as zero textbook costs, more accessibility, and more flexibility).</p>
    Among   these   four   cybersecurity   general   education   courses,key goals were to:
    <ul>
        <li>Increase cybersecurity knowledge in the general populace/home user and promote better cyber hygiene on personal devices [30] –   [32]</li>
        <li>Develop basic technical skills such as analyzing risks and conducting forensics [31] and performing traffic analysis and incident response [32]</li>
        <li>Convey a general understanding of computer and cybersecurity history, cybercrime, common threats and vulnerabilities, and related legal and ethical matters, [31] –   [33]</li>
        <li>Encourage awareness and behavior change regarding oversharing of personal information, social engineering, and safe web browsing [30].</li>
        <li>Promote good workplace behavior by introducing students to the kinds of cybersecurity expectations ofemployers and discussing “why they should cooperate with their employer in securing the workplace” [30, p. 187].</li>
        <li>Understand and explain the interrelation of cybersecurity to other disciplines/professions and the potential impacts of future change [33].</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Faculty  in  all  four  courses  [30]  – [33]  indicated  that  an  additional  goal  of  their  general  education  cybersecurity  experience  was  to  engage  a  broader,  more  diverse  student  population   in   the   hopes   of   enhancing   enrollments   in   cybersecurity    majors    and    boosting    the    cybersecurity    workforce.</p>
    <p>Some  authors,  e.g.,  [31],  [32],  and  [34],  noted  the  need  for further innovation on how to educate non-cybersecurity majors so as to reap the personal, organizational, and societal benefits of a more cybersecurity-savvy populace. As part of a  wider  call  for  increasing  cybersecurity  understanding  among  home  users  and  K-12  students,  as  well  as  among  organizations’   executive   leadership,   [34]   advocated   for   inclusion    of    cybersecurity    in    post-secondary    general    education; that article did not expound on the alignment with general  education  or  suggest  curricula  beyond  a  listing  of  eight general themes</p>
    <p>So,  while  there  appears  to  be  an  increased  call  for,  and  experimentation   with,   general   education   cybersecurity   courses, the examples here can be summarized as (i) military academy courses that relate cybersecurity to the professional missions of those academies and (ii) civilian courses that (for the   majority)   focus   on   personal/home   user   behavior,   fundamental    technical    skills    and    basic    cybersecurity    knowledge,    and    recruitment    into    the    cybersecurity    disciplines/workforce.</p>
    <h2>IV. EMPOWERING CYBERSECURITY BEHAVIOR AND CULTURE WITH A GENERAL EDUCATION COURSE</h2>
    <p>This section synthesizes the discussions in Sections II and III and proposes some recommendations for a cybersecurity general education course that supports the purposes of general education as well as organizations’ need to enhance fundamental cybersecurity knowledge of employees and to foster cybersecurity behavior in alignment with organizational cyber risk management.</p>
    <p>As discussed in the above sections, general education is aimed   not   just   toward   individual   improvements   and professional preparation, but also toward garnering benefits for communities/groups and society writ large. All types of organizations  face  the  common  challenge  of  improving  cybersecurity  understanding  and  awareness  among  their  employees.     Increased     cybersecurity     knowledge     and     normalized  cybersecurity  behaviors  are  competencies  that  can  be  carried  by  individuals  from  one  organization  to  another. “Home user” education is a good step toward better cybersecurity   practices,   but   it   does   not   encompass   the   workplace cybersecurity challenges involving non-technical end users</p>
    <p>Further,  studies  of  the  perception  of  students  toward  general  education  courses  show  that  students  most  value  those general education courses that they can directly relate to   their   future   careers.   A   cybersecurity   course   that   specifically     targets     workplace     expectations—and     is     transparent as to this goal and the pedagogical approaches — can build on this career-related impact to help foster student motivation and engagement.</p>
    <p>At  the  same  time,  and  as  seen  in  some  of  the  examples  discussed  above,  a  cybersecurity  general  education  course  focused on the individual’s role in an organization can also support general educational goals of promoting certain moral characteristics    and    liberal    education    values    such    as    considering    broader    perspectives,    questioning    deeper,    weighing community impacts of individual decisions, etc.</p>
    <p>This alignment with general education goals is especially evident  in  the  teaching  of  cyber  risk  management,  where  individual  risk  is  also  a  component  of  group/organizational  risk. The interrelationship of risk decisions and consequences can be explored with examples and extrapolation to broader contexts,   e.g.,   for   understanding   and   assessing   both   individual  risk  and  community  risk  in  situations  such  as  public  health  (skills  that  were  challenging  for  many  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic).  Helping  individuals  to  consider  the  wider  effects  of  their  decisions  may  add  additional  motivation    when    graduates    participate    in    workplace    cybersecurity training/awareness activities</p>
    <p>Currently,  innumerable  public  and  private  entities—across  a  swath  of  professions—are  attempting  to  teach  similar   fundamental   concepts   and   to   promote   similar   behavior change as part of their organizational cybersecurity training and awareness activities. Most organizations are not experts in education or training, and many are stymied by the challenges  inherent  in  these  efforts  and  by  employees’  neutralizing   behaviors   (justifications   for   not   following   security protocol).</p>
    <p>A cybersecurity general education course for all students could  provide  a  more  solid  foundation  for  organizational  efforts to build upon. The course could start addressing those neutralizing  approaches  and  could  help  fulfill  a  general  education mission of enabling a more engaged, responsible, and capable citizenry.</p>
    <p>Such   a   cybersecurity   course   could   be   designed   in   alignment with each educational institution’s own priorities for  general  education  (e.g.,  emphasizing  professional  or  liberal    education    competencies    or    both,    encouraging    appreciation   for   certain   characteristics,   etc.)   while   also   fulfilling common, unmet needs in our workplaces.</p>
    A  recommended  approach  is  to  not  start  with  content  (firewalls, spam, etc.) but rather to design a curriculum based on  general  education  goals  that  incorporate  common  needs  for  cybersecurity  knowledge  and  behavior  change  in  all  workplaces. For example, learning objectives could include the ability to:
    <ul>
        <li>Construct real-world examples of the interconnected systems that we all work and live within and describe how threats, vulnerabilities, and opportunities may evolve</li>
        <li>Explain how individual, daily activities can impact the security posture of an organization or community</li>
        <li>Identify real-world factors (social, economic, political) that may alter everyday decisions and consequentially affect organizational cybersecurity postures.</li>
        <li>Develop practices to deliberatively consider risk during daily activities, looking at individual, organizational, and societal consequences (near term and future).</li>
        <li>Extrapolate common cybersecurity problems to a particular situation (e.g., hospital, factory, law firm, etc.) and recommend approaches for sustaining cybersecurity awareness among employees there.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>The OER approach is also recommended. Although this involves  considerably  more  effort  on  the  teacher’s  part,  the  flexibility of OER allows for better customization to a post-secondary  institution’s  general  education  approach  and  for  more  timely  adaptation  of  curriculum  to  current  events  (to  help further engage students).</p>
    <p><p>Further,  studies  of  the  perception  of  students  toward  general  education  courses  show  that  students  most  value  those general education courses that they can directly relate to   their   future   careers.   A   cybersecurity   course   that   specifically     targets     workplace     expectations—and     is     transparent as to this goal and the pedagogical approaches — can build on this career-related impact to help foster student motivation and engagement.</p>
    <p>At  the  same  time,  and  as  seen  in  some  of  the  examples  discussed  above,  a  cybersecurity  general  education  course  focused on the individual’s role in an organization can also support general educational goals of promoting certain moral characteristics    and    liberal    education    values    such    as    considering    broader    perspectives,    questioning    deeper,    weighing community impacts of individual decisions, etc.</p>
    <p>This alignment with general education goals is especially evident  in  the  teaching  of  cyber  risk  management,  where  individual  risk  is  also  a  component  of  group/organizational  risk. The interrelationship of risk decisions and consequences can be explored with examples and extrapolation to broader contexts,   e.g.,   for   understanding   and   assessing   both   individual  risk  and  community  risk  in  situations  such  as  public  health  (skills  that  were  challenging  for  many  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic).  Helping  individuals  to  consider  the  wider  effects  of  their  decisions  may  add  additional  motivation    when    graduates    participate    in    workplace    cybersecurity training/awareness activities</p>
    <p>Currently,  innumerable  public  and  private  entities—across  a  swath  of  professions—are  attempting  to  teach  similar   fundamental   concepts   and   to   promote   similar   behavior change as part of their organizational cybersecurity training and awareness activities. Most organizations are not experts in education or training, and many are stymied by the challenges  inherent  in  these  efforts  and  by  employees’  neutralizing   behaviors   (justifications   for   not   following   security protocol).</p>

    <p>It  should  be  acknowledged  that  the  recommendations  here  would  primarily  impact  those  employees  who  have  attended  colleges  with  general  education  programs.  While  the  number  of  college  graduates  is  growing  and  over  two  million  bachelor’s  degrees  were  conferred  in  2020  alone  [35], many other employees move into the workplace directly from  secondary  education  or  from  a  vocational  technical  program. Various scholars and organizations, such as [36] – [39],  are  working  to  improve  cybersecurity  education  and  tr aining  for  youth  and  young  adults  outside  of  the  college  environment,  and  these  efforts  should  be  considered  in parallel  with  this  paper’s  call  for  a  post-secondary  general  education  course  for  improving  workplace  and  societal  cybersecurity.</p>
    <section id="CONCLUSION">
        <p>Organizations in the public and private sectors face common challenges in their cybersecurity training and awareness activities for non-technical end users of their systems. The deeper goal is behavior change: fostering the skills and attitude shifts needed for the organization to achieve its desired cybersecurity posture and to maintain a cybersecure culture in which employees understand their roles and regularly monitor their everyday decisions and activities with due regard to their consequential impacts on organizational cybersecurity and cyber risk management. In the United States, post-secondary general education aims to instill certain characteristics in graduates across all majors; these competencies are based in both liberal education and professional preparations and typically have outcomes that blend benefits to the individual graduate with benefits to various communities and the democratic society. A cybersecurity general education course can help to fulfill not only the professional preparation needs of graduates facing cybersecurity expectations in the workplace, it also can help to promote the general education goals of a post-secondary institution. Such a course should focus on interconnected and communal/organizational risks, processes of decision making and problem solving in collaborative and complex situations, and an understanding of and advocacy for individual responsibility to a collective cybersecurity good.</p>

        <h2>HTML Abuse</h2>
        <p><strong>Font Choices:</strong>For this project, I opted for a combination of "Abril Fatface" and "Times New Roman" as the primary font families. 
        "Abril Fatface" brings an elegant and distinctive touch to the headings, while "Times New Roman" ensures readability and a classic feel for the body text.</p>
        <p><strong>Heading and Text Sizes:</strong>The heading sizes have been thoughtfully selected to create visual hierarchy and aid in content navigation. 
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is reserved for the main title, setting it apart as the highest-level heading with the font-size 36px. 
        Subsequent headings, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, decrease in font size, maintaining a clear hierarchy with the font-size 23px and 21px.
        The main text is set to 16px, striking a balance between readability and aesthetically pleasing proportions.</p>
        <p><strong>Color Choices:</strong> Color plays a crucial role in conveying the tone and enhancing the visual appeal. 
        The color palette was chosen with care: 
        <span style="color: #B22222;">#B22222</span> for a bold and attention-grabbing red in the main title - <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> , 
        <span style="color: #00008B;">#00008B</span> for a deep blue in secondary headings - <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> , 
        and <span style="color: #800080;">#800080</span> for a rich purple accent for - <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> .</p>
        <p><strong>Margin and Padding:</strong> A padding of 20px is applied to the body for a comfortable spacing around the content. This, along with center alignment, enhances the overall aesthetics.</p>
        <p>#Color: Styles a specific element with the ID "Color," giving it a background color for which i have used #E6E6FA, padding as 10px, and border pages as 5px.</p>
	<p>For the unordered list - i have given list-style-type as disc and padding-left with 20px.</p>
	<p> The Color, font-size and font-family has been changed from the previous Lab2 </p>
        <p>Any HTML choices made for purely aesthetic reasons in the previous version have been revised. For instance, h2 tags are now appropriately used for headings.</p>
